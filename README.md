 The task was to build a model that takes a user query and
 returns the most relevant questions from the list of FAQs.
 To achieve this, we employed GloVe embeddings to convert
 words into vector representations. We developed a prediction
 function which uses similarity scores between the questions
 and queries to identify the closest matching questions.
 The model was deployed on Streamlit and hosted on
 Streamlit Cloud platform, ensuring fast, accurate results
 while being both scalable and resource-efficient.
